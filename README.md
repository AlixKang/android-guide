### **Time Commitment**

Udacity recommends setting aside 6 hours/week to work on the lessons. Your actual mileage may vary based on lesson and programming background, so budget or adapt accordingly.

In addition, we will meet (as a study group) for 1-2 hours a week, time that you can use for Q&A, discussion -- or simply to work on your own Android project or to explore advanced features related to that lesson.


### Udacity Resources

Check out their [an Android Studio Setup Guide](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/1395568821/AndroidStudioSetupGuide.pdf) -- however some of the content (e.g., videos) may be slightly out-of-date since they predate the latest Android Studio 1.0 release.

Check out their [Materials section](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud853) for more resources and downloadable content for each lesson. Note that its possible to download all videos and watch them offline (if network connectivity is an issue).

Check out their [complete Sunshine app on GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine) with a branch for each lesson/step. Use this as a reference only if you get stuck - its always best to do the exercise yourself to gain a better understanding of the materials.

### GDG Hudson Valley Resources

**Prep Session:** We'll kick off with a session to cover the big picture, and to help with initial setup and other questions. [Register here to attend](http://www.meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley/events/219282068/). The presentation is also [available online here](http://bit.ly/androidjamprep).

**Study Sessions:** We will hold regular (weekly) study sessions to review materials, answer questions or debug issues. You MUST join the [GDG Hudson Valley](http://www.meetup.com/gdg-hudson-valley/) meetup and RSVP for each event. A "living document" version of the [review presentation is available here](http://bit.ly/gdghv-session1). It will continue to be updated on a weekly basis over the course of the Jam.

**Hangouts:** We may complement in-venue meetings with online hangouts run on Google+. When these are held, they will be announced on our [GDG Hudson Valley community page](https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/116637480947982055865/communities/102846463613728256642) and you will need to RSVP there to join.

**Chatroom:** You can join the [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/gdg-hudson-valley/android-guide) (below) for interactive discussion at any time. The chat room maintains a sliding window of 2 weeks of history which will be enough to scan or recap the just-past, current and upcoming week discussions.
